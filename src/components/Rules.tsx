            <h1>1) Respect All Players.</h1>
            <p>No Racism, No Homophobia, No Ageism, No Transphobia, No Sexism, No Ableism and generally no discrimination at all based on any other immutable characteristic. Avoid being rude. If someone is being rude to you, get evidence to report that to a member of staff. Then /ignore or block any player that is being rude towards you.</p>
            <h1>2) No hateful or creepy activity</h1>
            <p>No Nazi or Communist symbolism, no recognised hate symbols or anything that causes or celebrates harm to other humans</p>
            <h1>3) No spam</h1>
            <p>Do not spam chat, not with server IPs, not with random strings of characters, not even with names of people you admire. No spam.</p>
            <h1>4) No griefing. This includes griefing just outside the bounds of a claim.</h1>
            <p>It's bad etiquette.</p>
            <h1>5) No hacked or modified items/blocks or client</h1>
            <p>You must report any hacked items or clients and hacked items or blocks must be either destroyed or given to a member of staff as soon as possible.</p>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> There is a list of approved mods in ‚Å†approved-mods. We recommend you read the list to ensure you are only using the ones that are allowed.</p>
            <h1>6) Swearing is allowed but only if it is not used to insult another player</h1>
            <p>This would be covered under our Respect All Players rule but we believed this was worth outlining separately to clear up any confusion.</p>
            <h1>7) Chat Language</h1>
            <p>This is an English only server. Speaking other languages in chat both in game & in discord is not allowed, for moderation purposes.</p>
            <h1>8) Abide by Discords Community Guidelines <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">https://discord.com/guidelines</a> as well as the Minecraft Community Standards <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards">https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards</a></h1>
